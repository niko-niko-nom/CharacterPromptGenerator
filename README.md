<h1>CharacterPromptGenerator</h1>
The repository for a Character Design Prompt Generator I'm building. (This is a student project.)

<h2>Goals</h2>
This project is intended as a tool for any artist who has the motivation to draw, but can't come up with ideas.<br>
The website will generate certain keywords that a creative can use to base their next illustration, character design or 3D-model on.<br>
Any and all keywords in any category can either be lowered in likelihood of appearing, or turned off copmletely.<br>
Ideally the website will have certain features locked behind a log-in screen, so that the user can save generated prompts to their account and display them on any device.

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
My target audience is 2D-artists, character designers, 3D-modellers, DnD enthusiasts, etc., anyone who needs or wants to create a character design for whatever project they're working on.

<h2>User Flow</h2>
New visitor generating a prompt: wants to create a character design -> lands on home-page -> plays around with settings (odds and selectable keywords) -> clicks generate until a good prompt appears -> prompt is saved in cookies for next visit.<br>
Registered user generating a prompt: wants to create a character design -> lands on home-page -> plays around with settings (odds and selectable keywords) -> clicks generate until a good prompts appears -> clicks to save prompt for later reference.<br>
Second-time visitor wants to find an old prompt: lands on home-page -> pop-up asking if the visitor wants to continue with their old settings and prompt.<br>
Registered user wants to find an old prompt: lands on home-page -> navigates to their library -> finds all saved prompts.<br>
