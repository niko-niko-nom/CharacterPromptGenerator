# CharacterPromptGenerator
The repository for a Character Design Prompt Generator I'm building. (This is a student project)

<h1>Goals</h1>
This project is intended as a tool for any artist who has the motivation to draw, but can't come up with ideas.
The website will generate certain keywords that a creative can use to base their next illustration, character design or 3D-model on.
Any and all keywords in any category can either be lowered in likelihood of appearing, or turned off copmletely.
Ideally the website will have certain features locked behind a log-in screen, so that the user can save generated prompts to their account and display them on any device.

<h1>Target Audience</h1>
My target audience is 2D-artists, character designers, 3D-modellers, DnD enthusiasts, etc., anyone who needs or wants to create a character design for whatever project they're working on.
